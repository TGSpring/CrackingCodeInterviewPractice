# **Cracking the Coding Interview - Practice Problems**

### **Author:** Tyler Spring  
**Start Date:** October 18, 2024  

This repository contains my solutions and code practice for the problems from the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* by **Gayle Laakmann McDowell**. My goal is to systematically work through the chapters to build my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## **Repository Structure**

Each chapter is represented by a directory, with solutions to individual questions organized in relevant files.

## **Why I am doing this:**

I am committed to practicing these problems to:
  * Strengthen my data structures and algorithms knowledge.
  * Prepare thoroughly for coding interviews.
  * Develop confidence and fluency in problem-solving under time constraints.
  * Improve my Java coding skills along with critical thinking abilities.
