 * Pairwise Swap.
 */


 Write a function to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as 
 few instructions as possible. For example:
    If the binary representation of the number is 101010 (42 in decimal), the 
    output should be 010101 (21 in decimal).

To swap odd and even bits:
    Extract the odd bits.
    Extract the even bits.
    Shift the odd bits to the even positions.
    Shift the even bits to the odd positions.
    Combine the results.

STEPS TO SOLVE:
    Extract the even bits by performing a bitwise AND with the mask 0xAAAAAAA.

    Extract the odd bits by performing a bitwise AND with the mask 0x5555555.

    Shift the even bits right by 1 to move them to odd positions.
    Shift the odd bits left by 1 to move them to even positions.
    Combine the two results using a bitwise OR.

Time Complexity:
The operation involves constant-time bitwise operations:
    Extracting bits with mask.
    Shifting.
    Combining results with OR. Thus, the solution runs in O(1) time.
